Project Name: Peddy

**Description:** Peddy is a pet adoption platform designed to connect people with adoptable animals. It allows users to browse through a variety of pets, learn more about them, and potentially adopt their furry companion.

**5 Key Features:**

1. **Pet Browsing:** Users can easily explore a wide range of adoptable pets, filtered by category and sortable by price(when category is selected).
2. **Detailed Pet Information:** Each pet listing provides comprehensive information, including images, name, breed, age, gender, and a brief description.
3. **Adoption Process:** The platform guides users through the adoption process, providing necessary information. User friendly interface ensure butoon is disabled when adoption completed and confirmation modal appear.
4. **Liking and Favorites:** Users can "like" pets they are interested in, creating a personalized list.
5. **Contact Information:** The platform provides contact details for adoption centers or individuals responsible for the listed pets.

**ES6 Features Used:**

* **Template Literals:** Used for cleaner string formatting, especially when embedding variables within strings (creating dynamic button text, image paths).
* **Arrow Functions:** Used for concise anonymous function definitions, particularly for event listeners and callback functions.
* **`const` and `let`:** Used for improved variable declaration and scoping, preventing accidental reassignment and ensuring block-level scope respectively.
* **Destructuring:** Used in a few places to extract properties from objects in a more readable way from a pet object.
 **`fetch` API:** Used to make HTTP requests to retrieve pet data from an external API.
